# CodeQL .NET Demo Project Work Log

## Setup and Initial Configuration

1. Created a basic .NET solution with three projects:
   - `CodeQLDemo.Api`: Main ASP.NET Core Web API project
   - `CodeQLDemo.Common`: Common library project
   - `CodeQLDemo.Security`: Security-related functionality project

2. Added CodeQL configuration:
   - Created `codeql-config.yml` with extraction settings for C#
   - Created `justfile` with recipes for:
     - Building the solution
     - Initializing CodeQL database
     - Running CodeQL analysis
     - Cleaning up CodeQL artifacts

3. Initial CodeQL Analysis:
   - Successfully installed CodeQL CLI (version 2.20.0)
   - Verified C# language support and extractors
   - Successfully created CodeQL database
   - Ran security analysis with extended query suite
   - Analysis covered 7 out of 15 C# files
   - No security issues found in the initial codebase (expected as it's a basic template)

## Learnings

1. CodeQL Database Creation:
   - Requires proper build configuration
   - Added MSBuild properties to improve build logging and analysis:
     ```xml
     <UseSharedCompilation>false</UseSharedCompilation>
     <GenerateFullPaths>true</GenerateFullPaths>
     <UseRoslynAnalyzers>false</UseRoslynAnalyzers>
     ```

2. CodeQL Analysis:
   - Successfully used the `codeql/csharp-queries:codeql-suites/csharp-security-extended.qls` query suite
   - Analysis runs multiple security-focused queries covering:
     - SQL Injection
     - XSS
     - Path Traversal
     - Command Injection
     - And many other security vulnerability patterns

## Next Steps

1. Add more complex functionality to test security analysis:
   - Database operations
   - File system operations
   - User input processing
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Cryptographic operations

2. Introduce controlled security vulnerabilities to verify CodeQL detection capabilities

## Environment Details

- OS: Darwin 24.1.0
